### Introduction

The plug API is seperated into two systems, 
[WebSocket](https://github.com/plugcommunity/documentation/tree/master/api/events) and 
[REST](#).
While the WebSocket part is used to communicate at real time (such as chat, booth advancement etc.), the REST API is 
used to do everything that does not require a real time connection. While this certainly induces a bit of latency
for each action, it is something that can be easily handled with.


### Tips and tricks

One thing to mention is that you can only send a limited amount of request in a certain timespan, if you overdo it 
for a longer amount of time you'll be banned. This can certainly happen when you decide to to delete
a bunch of chat messages without artifically slowing the amount of requests down.
